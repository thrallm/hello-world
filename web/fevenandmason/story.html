				<h2>Our story</h2>
				Feven and Mason’s story began in March 2013 on a night out in Denver.  They both met up with a mutual friend in LoDo never having met each other previously. Mason contests this account, as he is adamant they “met” a few months earlier at an event for Feven’s work. Feven, of course believes Mason, but as a recovering workaholic, the only thing she recalls are work related events on the date in question.  
				As they say, what is meant will be, and on that fateful night in March 2013, Mason and Feven met again.  Before the night was over, Mason managed to make Feven laugh to the point of tears with insightful observations about Betty Sue (Feven’s car) and UMB bank (ask Mason). A week later Mason and Feven were on their first date and the rest is history.  They have been blissfully loving and growing together ever since that fateful night in March.  They can’t wait for you to join them in celebrating their LOVE! 
				<h2>Our Ceremony</h2>
				The wedding ceremony is a compilation of Feven and Mason’s personal desires balanced with their family traditions. The wedding will be held over a two day period, July 2nd and July 3rd.  The first day will include a wedding ceremony at the Carousel followed by a reception much like a typical American wedding.  On the second day, a traditional celebration called Mels/Melsi will take place.
				<br/><br/>
				A Mels/Melsi is a traditional celebration from Feven’s culture.  Weddings in Feven’s cultural tradition typically last several days and the Mels/Melsi is a casual and intimate celebration hosted by the family for close family and friends. Everything, from the bride's hair, accessories, traditional attire and the adornment of henna is drastically different from day one.  The wedding party will be dressed in traditional attire, see example here. 
				<br/><br/>
				The Mels/Melsi usually starts with preparations by the wedding party to get dressed up for the event. For guests, the celebrations will begin at 7 o’clock at the Greek Asuncion event center (link to map?). The celebration is comprised of lots of eating and dancing. Celebration is the key word for this event. An invitation to attend a Mels/Melsi is considered a mark of friendship and respect and an indication of closeness to the family.  At the Mels/Melsi traditional Ethiopian food will be served and traditional music from Eritrea, Ethiopia and United States will be played by DJ Fitsum. 
				<h2>The food!</h2>
				On the first day of the wedding, we will have traditional habesha food as well as Mexican food! The food will be served buffet style.  Choose your preference and enjoy!
				To help with familiarize you with the cuisine, please view the below videos: an introduction to eating Ethiopian food and a great video from the all-American Simpson family on their show about eating Ethiopian food. Enjoy!
