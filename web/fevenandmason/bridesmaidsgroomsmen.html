				<h3>Rahwa Netsanet</h3>
				<a href="images/rahwa.jpg"><img src="images/rahwa.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" width="100px" align="left"/></a>
				My name is Rahwa and I'm Feven's younger sister, and soon to be sister-in-law to Mason!  I still remember the first day I met Mason: I was volunteering with Feven's work project at the time which included tabling at City Park. We were talking about boys - ooooooooh - and she mentioned she had a date that day with a guy named Mason after work, "He's super nice, and we're going out today." She didn't say much more, but when he showed up, they were both blushing.  It's like that old saying goes, 'If you can make a black woman blush, you've got her heart'.  And so it began, a years-long relationship that is taking a new step into the future.  Mason is lucky to have caught my sister when he did, and I am so happy for what is to come!
				<h3>Adom Netsanet</h3>
				<a href="images/adom.jpg"><img src="images/adom.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" width="100px"/></a>
				ADOM!
				<h3>Courtney Thrall</h3>
				<a href="images/courtney.jpg"><img src="images/courtney.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" width="100px" align="left"/></a>
				Mason is my brother. He is an amazing person. He is one of the most kind, generous, hilarious, and determined people I know. Lucky for me, he met Feven, who is equally amazing. She's kind, generous, hilarious, determined. I am so glad to have her in our family, and feel so grateful to have been welcomed into hers. So thrilled to be your sister-in-law!
				<h3>Milen Redda</h3>
				<a href="images/milen.jpg"><img src="images/milen.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" width="100px" align="left"/></a>
				Hey I am Millen! I also go by Milla as Feven and the rest of my family would often call me. Feven and I met ... wait I think I was 5 months old when she first came to this world. So quite frankly home girl and I have been kicking it for a while (like 30 years ) Sorry Fev! Did not mean to put that out there lol. Growing up we were inseparable and we were each other's playmate, best friend, and sister. My childhood would never have been the same without her. We have shared so many beautiful memories filled with laughter, silly jokes and pranks. Like the time when Feven went to the neighborhood shop with 50 cents and tried to buy some sunglasses and candy..... with all that money!   What about when we were both crying our eyes out while watching Hercules! I am not sure why or which part. I can go on and on forever about this girl but it would probably end up being a book.  We have been through thick and thin and I got to say I have never seen Feven happier! She has met the man of her dreams and I pray that God blesses their union! I love you both to the moon and back!!!
				<h3>Brooke Pfeuffer</h3>
				<a href="images/brooke.jpg"><img src="images/brooke.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" width="100px" align="left"/></a>
				I'm Brooke, and up until Feven met Mason, I was the love of Feven's life (don't believe her if she tries to dispute this). We met in college and lived together for several years in Boulder. During our college years Feven and I mostly bonded over the fact that we shared many of the same pleasures including long walks, sleeping, ice cream, snuggling, and procrastinating. I still remember the very first time I met Feven; I just KNEW that she was my person. Thirteen years later and I am still blessed enough to call her my sister-from-another-mister! If Feven isn't going to spend the rest of her life with me, I must say that Mason is most certainly the next best choice. He makes my friend shine, supports her dreams, and puts up with her loud and crazy girlfriends. Thank you Mason, for loving my friend. I could not have dreamed up a more perfect couple.
				<h3>Asmayt Bahta</h3>
				<a href="images/asmayt.jpg"><img src="images/asmayt.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" width="100px" align="left"/></a>
				Hi, I'm Asmayt and I am lucky enough to call myself one of Feven's oldest friends. We met in high school shortly after both of our families moved to the U.S. I don't think either one of us would have survived high school if it weren't for our friendship. I have always been a quiet person and Feven is... not a quiet person, so we balance each other out well. I remember the first time I saw her in the hallway of George Washington High School; I was a freshman and she was too she was walking with her giant, oversized backpack and she had a big stack of books in her arms (can you say nerd?!?). I'll always be grateful to her for helping me with my full time job of stalking my high school crush both on and off the school's campus. Watching Feven grow and and evolve from my nerdy school girl friend into the woman she is today has been such a privilege. Especially, in regards to her relationship with Mason. Feven is one of the most dedicated and hardworking person I know.  I have seen her open her guarded self up and let love happen. Feven is a fiercely loyal friend and she loves with her whole self. I believe Mason is lucky to have her and I cannot wait to see what the future holds for both of them. Welcome to our crazy "family" Mason. 
				<h3>Wintana Serekbrahane</h3>
				<a href="images/winta.jpg"><img src="images/winta.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" width="100px" align="left"/></a>
				I met Feven when I was a sophomore in high school. I didn't think that our outcast group of friends could possibly get any nerdier, but then came Feven with her cute little glasses, and her never ending stack of books. Our nerd quotient increased exponentially the day Feven joined us. I left for college at CU Boulder a year before Feven graduated and it was such a lonely year waiting for Feven to join us again.Once she got to Boulder, I remember how we (Sewit, Brookie, Feven, and Alisha) all pushed our mattresses together to form one GIANT BED in our tiny dorm room.  Somehow, even though there was a GIANT BED Feven still managed to take up an ungodly amount of space by rolling from one side of the bed to the other the ENTIRE night. Good luck to you Mason! I met Mason about two years ago at a housewarming party shortly after they moved in together. I was struck by how welcoming and caring he was. He went out of his way to make me comfortable. Feven has always been the "mom" of our group; she was always taking care of us and now she has Mason, and she can count on him to take care of her too. I am very happy that my Feven has found Mason, who loves her as much as she loves him.
				<h3>Selome Yakob</h3>
				<a href="images/selome.jpg"><img src="images/selome.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" width="100px" align="left"/></a>
				I have often heard that college is where you meet your lifetime friends, and I must agree.  I met Feven over a decade ago at CU Boulder when we both hanged out at the engineering building.  Neither of us were engineering majors, but we ended up spending a lot of time in that building for reasons I can’t recall.  Our friendship was one that was effortless, and filled with numerous adventures, laughter and some tears. Feven has served as my translator in Mexico, was my hiking buddy in Moab, my running buddy at City Park, and a thoughtful friend that would stop by work to check on me when I disappeared during busy season. Feven is a woman with a big heart that has wisdom beyond her years. I have loved having her counsel and humor throughout the years. I am so happy she has found her mate in Mason. I remember when Feven met Mason. I could tell he was a keeper by the way she talked about him. And the more I get to know him, the more I see that they are a perfect match. I'm so honored to be part of their wedding and their life.
				<h3>Lula Geday</h3>
				<a href="images/lula.jpg"><img src="images/lula.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" width="100px" align="left"/></a>
				If Feven started this story she would say something similar to, "in high school Lula was too popular to hang out with us nerds..." but that is far from the truth. The actual story was more like, I was a shy adolescent trying to break through the barriers of high school, so as I walked by Feven and her group of friends (who are also my friends now), I would say hi accompanied with a smile. However, instead of reciprocating the feeling with a warm smile, they looked at me like I was an alien and forced some greeting. I mean, I get it, my head can resemble one of an alien, but that was no way to make a little ol' freshman feel. However, with the most amazing and lasting friendships, we came full circle to a point of real love! Through a couple of awkward and memorable moments such as "can I sit on your couch?" and ingesting Feven's germs by licking her ice cream AFTER she licked it, I've come to just love her! She is a wonderful person, marrying a man who makes her that much better and I am excited for this new chapter of their lives.
				<h3>Sewit Haile</h3>
				<a href="images/sewit.jpg"><img src="images/sewit.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" width="100px" align="left"/></a>
				Feven and I met our freshman year of college.  Before we met, we had heard so much about each other from mutual friends that by the time we met, it felt like we already knew each other. I still remember the very first time we met; we both immediately began sharing funny (and amazingly embarrassing) stories with one another while laughing uncontrollably. I just loved her energy. I knew right then she and I would become close friends. We have so many fun stories and memories from our college days, but the moments I cherish the most about my friendship with Feven are the times we stayed up into the wee hours having long reflective discussions about anything and everything going on in life. Now we live miles apart but the distance hasn’t changed a thing, we still manage to have our usual several hour-long conversations, with the occasional “Remember when…” moments as we reminisce and laugh about some of our crazy adventures. I feel so blessed to have you as my friend and sister and can’t wait to be by your side as you marry the man you love and start your life together.
				<h3>Whittney Robinson-Johnson</h3>
				<a href="images/whittney.jpg"><img src="images/whittney.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" width="100px" align="left"/></a>
				Being a part of Feven's world has truly been an honor. If you know Feven, you know that she is loyal to those she loves. I have had the pleasure to grow and love with Feven for the past decade or so. It has also been a joy to watch the beginnings of Mason sweeping Feven off of her feet with witty science fiction jokes.... Or maybe it was Feven sweeping Mason off of his feet with her passionate political rants..... Either way, that loyal love that I have always received from my girl Feven since our unlikely friendship developed in the dorms years ago, is exactly the kind of deep love that Mason is jumping into. What a blessing to watch your phenomenal friend fall in love with a phenomenal man and be a part of their lives. Celebrating the lives you lead!
