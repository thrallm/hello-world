<i>Today, 58 million Americans spend approximately $30 billion every year to maintain over 23 million acres of lawn. That's an average of over a third of an acre and $517 each. The same size plot of land could still have a small lawn for recreation, plus produce all of the vegetables needed to feed a family of six. The lawns in the United States consume around 270 billion gallons of water a week--enough to water 81 million acres of organic vegetables, all summer long. (Heather Flores</i>, Food Not Lawns<i>)</i>

Flatirons Neighborhood Farm is a non-profit urban farm that was built by a community of farmers, gardeners, and activists in Boulder's Flatirons Neighborhood. We run a ten member CSA using homeowners' yards in our neighborhood to organically cultivate vegetables, flowers, and herbs.
<br/><br/>
The Farm seeks to be visually and practically instructive as a model of sustainable agriculture within our urban community, and aims to build community around a greater knowledge of healthy homegrown food.
<br/><br/>
Our produce will be distributed to local CSA shareholders, sold to local restaurants, and donated to local organizations working with families in need.
