<b>Transitioning a Lawn into a Garden</b></br>
<i>Learn how to transition a plain old, grass lawn into a productive garden.</i></br>
<i>Date: TBA, late Spring</i></br></br>
Why? We seek to provide opportunities for the bolstering neighborhood and community knowledge bases regarding urban agriculture. We wish to foster food-based community development, through relationship building with each other, our built environment, and the land.
</br></br>
<b>Composting</b></br>
<i>Date: TBA, early Summer</i></br></br>
Experiential education on the dynamics of composting in your backyard. We will be making a small compost pile in preparation for the fall nutrition needs of our gardens and in hopes that others might be inspired to divert their food and garden waste in a productive manner.
             
              Why?              In accordance with our mission, we seek to reduce the food-based carbon emissions of our community and thus we are reaching out to disseminate knowledge on an excellent waster diversion practice that can also serve as a natural fertilizer.
