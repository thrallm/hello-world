<div class='good'>What is a CSA?</div>
<br/>
<div style='text-align:justify'>A CSA (short for Community Supported Agriculture) is a model of distrubution of produce from a farm to a community, where you receive weekly "shares" of the harvest weekly throughout the growing season. "The essence of the (CSA) relationship is the mutual commitment: The Farm feeds the people; the people support the farm and share in the inherent risks and potential bounty" (<i>Sharing the Harvest</i>).</div>

<br/>
<div style='text-align:justified'>Our CSA shareholders will receive homegrown veggies for 20 weeks in the 2010 season, starting in late May and ending in late September. The Farm offers two sizes of CSA shares, regular (feeds 1-2 people) and hearty (feeds 3-4 people). Our regular-sized share is $225 and our hearty-sized share is $400. We also the option to purchase a Donated CSA share if you are interested in buying a share for a family in our neighborhood who otherwise would not access to fresh, locally grown produce. These donations are tax-deductible.</div>

<div style="text-align:center"><b>Thanks so much to everyone for your great support! We have sold all of our shares for 2010!</b></div>
